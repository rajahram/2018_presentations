Reinhold Koch,R reproducibility by containers and cloud,Roche,"R is pretty good in backwards compatibility but still reproducing analysis even given script and data can be a challenge as packages, R, and math libraries keep evolving. www.rocker-project.org offers among other things version-stable R in docker (Rocker) images. A small example will be presented how this allows on any docker runtime environment to execute analysis with highest reproducibility. Such environments are part of all major commercial cloud providers but also allow on-premises installations.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Koch_Reproducibility_by_Containers_and_Cloud.pdf
Volha Tryputsen,Antibody Characterization Using Next Generation Sequencing made easier with Group My Abs shiny app.,Johnson & Johnson,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS), phage display technology and high throughput capacities enables biologists in drug discovery to characterize antibodies (Abs) based on their HCDR3 sequences and further group them into families before moving to hit-to-lead stage of drug discovery and development. This enables diversification of Ab portfolio and insures back up options if Ab candidate fails. However, there was no method or software available in-house to support Ab discovery with capacities to apply biophysical rules to classify the sequences. 
Shiny app ""Group My Abs"" was developed to apply biophysical properties for Ab characterization to the NGS data. Several Multiple Sequence Alignment algorithms implemented in the app enable sequence comparability. A method was developed to evaluate differences between comparable sequences and subsequently classify sequences into families. The app provides custom-made and interactive data visualization, enables refined Ab classification in a mathematical manner, considerably increases efficiency and insures reproducibility. This all decreases bias and enables informative decision making during the hit-to-lead stage in biologics drug discovery.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Tryputsen-Antibody_Characterization_NGS_Group_My_Abs.pdf
"Boyd Gonnerman, John Sims, Frank DePierro and Peter Giardina",Using R in a GxP Environment,Pfizer,"The Data Science team in Pfizer’s Vaccine Research and Development division (VRD) creates and maintains validated applications used during high-throughput clinical testing that enable advanced analytic and reporting requirements. SAS has long been the de-facto standard for analyzing data in a regulated GxP environment. Web deployment of these applications has been the best approach, and Pfizer VRD has developed several mid-tier applications in Java that submit batch SAS processes on a High Performance Computing grid. Pfizer VRD’s high level approach is the same across different assay platforms: data are pulled from a combination of electronic files and Oracle databases and analyzed, results are written back to an Oracle database, and electronic output files are made in various formats (e.g. PDF). The regulated nature of Pfizer VRD’s work and the difficulty in deploying R-based applications over the web have previously been an impediment to the use of R, but new tools such as RStudio’s Shiny Server Pro have helped us overcome those challenges. This presentation focuses on a comparison of the architecture used to deploy our SAS applications and the infrastructure required to deploy R-based applications to meet GxP requirements. Real life examples will be provided to illustrate the usefulness of this platform in a regulated laboratory environment.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Gonnerman-R_in_a_GxP_Environment.pptx
Jun Li,Data-Driven Strategies for Synthetic Route Design and Operational Modeling within Pharmaceutical Development,Bristol Myers Squibb,"Decision analysis balancing both data analytics and human gut feeling is critical in designing efficient routes to synthesize new, complex small molecules.  This challenge is faced by any organization seeking to deliver modern pharmaceutical compounds to patients in a prompt manner. In this presentation, we highlight the incorporation of data science approaches using R to develop metrics that aid in the development process:  current complexity, risk quantification, and process efficiency forecasting.  Current complexity is a metric established from human insights that assesses a molecule’s complexity in the context of capability, tracking the ‘current’ complexity of a given molecule over time and enabling the quantitative assessment of a new route or process.  Risk quantification utilizes a Bayesian framework to quantify risk from real data and operational patterns, at both the project and portfolio level, for assessing the delivery risk of early candidate nomination assets in areas such as FTE resource modeling.  Process efficiency can be estimated with a predictive analytics framework capable of quantifying the probable efficiency of a proposed synthesis or benchmarking the outcome performance of the developed process, thereby minimizing the environmental impact of pharmaceutical production.  These strategies have been effectively used to aid the decision-making processes for pharmaceutical R&D.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Li-Synthetic_Route_Design_and_Operational_Modeling.pptx

James Black,The role of R in converting clinical trial programmers to data scientists,Roche,"In 3 years Real World Data Science Analytics in Roche/Genentech transitioned from a small team of former clinical trial programmers supporting a real world evidence team to become the largest department within the Personalised Healthcare (PHC) Centre of Excellence. This transition was driven by industry-wide acknowledgement of the growing importance of leveraging analytics to support PHC, but this change necessitated radical changes in workflows and competencies. To adapt to this change, the team has moved from using a single proprietary software (SAS) to becoming an open source-focused, R based but increasingly programming language agnostic, department. A core driver of this transition was the development of an internal suite of R packages that handled markdown templates and database access through to wrappers for common plots and documenting git hashes of all code used. Bringing this diverse set of tools into a coherent eco-system is a meta-package modelled on the tidyverse.",https://phcanalytics.github.io/slides/aboutus/RinPharma2018/

Stefanie Butland,rOpenSci - enabling open and reproducible research,rOpenSci,"The rOpenSci project is a non-profit initiative founded as a grassroots effort in 2011. We have evolved into a truly global community of researchers and data scientists who are R users and developers from a wide range of disciplines. rOpenSci advocates for a culture of open and reproducible research. We do this by creating technical infrastructure in the form of carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web. We have developed a highly successful model for peer review of scientific software that provides transparent, constructive and collegial review of R packages. 

Our community is our best asset. We are building social infrastructure in the form of a welcoming and diverse community. rOpenSci.org hosts blog posts by authors and reviewers of onboarded packages to share both functionality and lessons learned; we promote these on social media to bring their work to a wider audience. Our discussion forum, community calls and annual hackathon-flavored unconference are designed to share best practices and to build a trust network for the often challenging discussions about doing research more reproducibly.

Jessica Minnier,Shiny Apps in Genomics and Clinical Trials,Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU),"R Shiny has revolutionized the way statisticians and analysts distribute analytic results and research methods. We can easily build interactive web tools that enhance data visualization and facilitate data and information sharing. Shiny apps can empower non-statisticians to explore and visualize their data or perform their own analyses with methods we develop. Harnessing this power, R users have developed Shiny apps for visualizing clinical trials and pharmaceutical data, as well as applications that aid in study design and analysis. I will present examples of how Shiny can be used in many stages of the drug development process and discuss the challenges as well as benefits of incorporating these tools in pharmaceutical workflows.",https://jminnier-talks.netlify.com/2018_08_rpharma_shiny/minnier_rpharma2018.html
Rena J. Eudy-Byrne,The Use of R in the Development of Physiological Model for Healthy Growth,Metrum Research Group,"A physiologically-based mathematical model was developed as a series of ordinary differential equations to describe compositional changes (in fat and fat-free mass, FM & FFM) due to metabolizable energy exchanges in babies from birth to 2 years in low-to-middle income countries.1  The objective of this work was to identify potential biomarkers for future intervention studies, identify when to intervene to protect and/or rescue growth in individuals suffering from malnutrition, and to identify which of these individuals would be more or less likely to respond to a nutritional intervention.

A translation of this model (155 parameters and 26 compartments) using  R and the open-source mrgsolve package2 provided an  efficient platform for  multi-parameter optimization, as required during additional model development and for subsequent simulations. For comparison, a 8.62 seconds simulation with viral and bacterial infections (no interventions) in the R/mrgsolve implementation required 226 seconds in Matlab. Model translation to R also enabled simulations with a Shiny App, allowing users to simulate individual infant phenotypes and infection events and visualize growth and energy levels over time, relative to healthy (WHO) standards.

The model currently also includes a relatively simple implementation of persistent antibiotic therapy with a potential for inclusion of drug exposure-related effects, i.e. - through a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, to describe effects of antiviral or antibiotic therapy. The challenge to this development is the scarcity of available data describing this therapy in malnourished children that would be needed for model calibration. Further development of the model includes linking to other systems models such Mother-fetus energy exchange or PBPK mother-fetus models, to enable simulations of growth beginning at gestation.

This is certainly true in experiments relying on quantitative mass spectrometry. This relatively new and rapidly evolving field must overcome many sources of unwanted variation. It has many unsolved challenges, both in the appropriate use of the existing methods and tools, and in developing methods that address specialized problems. 

This talk will illustrate our R-based efforts to promote sound statistical practice, and build a community of competent practitioners. First, we will present Cardinal, a comprehensive tool for quantitative mass spectrometry-based imaging, as well as MSstats, a general but flexible framework for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We will highlight the importance of these tools for pharmaceutical research in an example of statistical characterization of therapeutic protein modifications. Second, we will detail our efforts of building a community of competent users through a world-wide series of short courses, intended for experimentalists and computational scientists alike.

Mat Soukup,Unification in a Compartmentalized Culture,FDA,"When it comes to analytics of data collected in medical research, today’s culture is compartmentalized – not only across institutions, but even within institutions. Such a culture stagnates analytical development and limits the ability to fully master the data thereby reducing the effectiveness in communicating clinical information to stakeholders. A unified culture can exist – statisticians, programmers, and clinicians need to speak to each other; regulatory agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and academics need to speak to each other. Once everyone comes together to discuss how the medical research data should be collected, interrogated and presented; analytics can be developed and shared within and across institutions. From an analytics perspective, nothing new needs to be developed, solutions are already available – many of them free. We just need to come together and start talking.

Kieran Martin,R4SPA: R Packages and Training to enable Statistical Programming in R,Roche,"R is a very powerful tool for performing statistical programming, but has had a lower uptake in the life sciences when compared to SAS. As a result, many of the packages created for R are not focused on the type of tasks Statistical Programmers do. In this talk I introduce several packages and in house training we are developing to aid regulatory outputs. The R packages include rcompare, a package to allow comparison of datasets, analogous to proc compare in SAS, and r4spa which allows outputs to be in the correct format for production. Each package solves a problem particular to the life sciences, and is intended to improve uptake of R usage within the industry.

Jay Timmerman,Enhance R Overview,Covance,"Recruitment models for clinical trials are notoriously difficult to build due to many complex factors within a study. With input from experienced practitioners, we have built an interactive tool to allow individuals to build complex recruitment models using the R/Shiny framework. The Tool Enhance R, our platform for study modeling, was ported from an Excel-based tool to the R/Shiny platform to increase model development speed, expand capability and drive transparency into model development. The tool allows users to specify critical model attributes (i.e. country site distribution, recruitment/activation rates, country-specific vacations), and provide instantaneous feedback that changes have on a model’s probability of success. Using the RStudio Connect platform, we are able to grant multi-level access to users through a single web interface. Model development is tracked by exporting results to a SharePoint site and logging versions for future review/auditing. This gives significant levels of transparency on how a model was created and evolved over time. For web analytics, we used Piwik, and internal web analytics platform, to monitor how users navigate through the platform and identify browsing behavior. The application was built upon the Shiny Dashboard framework and leverages many visualization packages, including Plotly, Timevis, ggplot2 and many more. Many challenges arose in its develop, from controlling over-zealous user clicks causing out of control execution, to integrating service account execution of apps to facilitate centralized data control.

Juliane Manitz,Multi-state Model for the Analysis of an Association between Safety and Efficacy Events,EMD Serono,"Safety and efficacy data in clinical trials are mostly analyzed separately. However, especially the treatment of life-threatening disease such as cancer requires a good understanding of benefit and associated risks to make an informed therapy decision for an individual patient. Recently approved immunotherapeutic drugs in oncology are associated with potential side effects such as immune-related hypothyroidism, rash and colitis. There is some biological reasoning that the occurrence of immune-related adverse events and corresponding management may compromise the drug response. On the other hand, it has been observed that patients responding to treatment might face a higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions. A multi-state model is able to explore these hypotheses and offers the opportunity of insights into potential associations while addressing some of the methodological challenges. For example, the necessity of a time-dependent approach to accommodate the fact that safety and efficacy events can occur throughout the treatment. Moreover, longer treatment duration can impact simultaneously the likelihood of efficacy as well as safety events, i.e., introducing immortal time bias. The multistate model is able to unfold this spurious correlation. We present an approach for analysis and exemplify the methodology with simulated data.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Manitz-Association_between_Safety_and_Efficacy_Events.pdf
Chase Clark,IDBac: A New Paradigm in Developing Microbial Libraries for Drug Discovery,"Student, University of Illinois at Chicago","The success of a bacterial drug discovery program can be no greater than the phylogenetic diversity and capacity of those bacteria in the library to produce specialized metabolites (SM). However, the methods used to create bacterial strain libraries have seen little innovation in nearly 80 years. Current practice relies entirely on colony morphology and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis to decide which isolated strains to retain for addition to a drug discovery library. However, these practices create inefficient libraries plagued with a high degree of taxonomic and chemical redundancy by relying on physical characteristics that have limited correlation with strains’ SM, the foundation of drug discovery. Therefore, the development of a platform to rapidly prioritize unknown bacterial strains based on phylogeny and SM would greatly increase the efficiency of the front-end of microbial drug discovery. Our lab has recently developed such a platform, called IDBac, which uses in situ matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to analyze protein and specialized metabolite spectra of single bacterial colonies. Utilizing R and Shiny, alongside state-of-the-art packages and techniques in MALDI processing and data visualization, we created a stand-alone executable program for MALDI-TOF MS bacterial analysis. Using unsupervised learning methods and visualizations we have demonstrated IDBac’s capabilities by creating protein and specialized metabolite MS profiles, generating protein MS hierarchical groupings that accurately mirrored phylogenetic groupings and further distinguishing isolates based on inter- and intra-species differences in specialized metabolite production. With the ease of use of modern MALDI instrumentation and interactive, intuitive data exploration, IDBac can rapidly profile up to 384 bacteria in 4 hours. To our knowledge, IDBac is the first attempt to couple in situ MS analyses of protein content and specialized metabolite production and will enable laboratories with access to a MALDI-TOF MS the ability to rapidly create more efficient libraries for their drug discovery programs.",https://github.com/rinpharma/2018_presentations/tree/master/talks_folder/2018-Clark-IDBac.pdf
